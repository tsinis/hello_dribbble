# Hello Dribbble

A interactive animations showcase project, I've made as my **Dribbble** Debut Shot: [dribbble.com/tsinis](https://dribbble.com/tsinis)

![Hello Dribbble](hello_dribbble.gif)

As you can see ball animation responds to touch/click + drag and so as cherished Dribbble invite ticket, that shows up in 3D. This is mainly made with [Rive](https://rive.app) (ex Flare) tool in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework. **Those kind of animations can embellish your ticketing, banking, card game etc. apps that simple.** You can see/fork those animations in my Rive [profile](https://rive.app/a/tsinis).

> **Note:** design is screen size and platform independent, because all the graphics is made in vectors (not bitmaps) in Flutter, you can download this project's binaries for your platform in [Releases](https://github.com/tsinis/hello_dribbble/releases) section.

## Showcase in Flutter

## Credits

All credits goes to [Rive](https://rive.app/) Team, this is truly game changer tool. Thanks for workshop I have inspired from ([Flare NYC Workshop and the Hamilton Design Challenge](https://medium.com/rive/flare-nyc-workshop-and-the-hamilton-design-challenge-ae8b2d1c73fc)) and especially to Rive Team member — [@JcToon](https://github.com/JcToon) for his [basketball animation](https://rive.app/a/JuanCarlos/files/flare/basketball-blur-effects/preview), I've forked. And of course, all this would have been impossible without [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter).
